## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?  
  The purpose of a method is to save time by not writing out the same code over and over  
1. In the space below, create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.  
  def hello(name = "Sam")  
    puts "#{name} I am"  
  end  

  hello()  
1. Create a method name `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.  
  def hello_someone(name)  
    puts "#{name} I am"   
  end  

  hello_someone("Sam")   
1. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?  
  hello_someone("Sam")  
1. What questions do you still have about methods in Ruby?  
  I honestly didn't really understand exercise 21 when they asked us to make our own function by hand.
